# Hello everyone! It's a pleasure to have you here.

Here you will find my professional experiences, skills, tools and projects involving Data Science.

As the projects below demonstrate, I am able to implement a complete Data Science project (“end-to-end”), from obtaining business requirements to publishing it in the cloud, including creating tools to access the Machine Learning Models for non-tech people.

## Skills:
* **Programming Languages:** Python.
* **Databases:** SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL).
* **Data visualization:** Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, folio), Streamlit, Telegram bots.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Central Tendency, Dispersion, kurtosis, density.
* **ML Algorithms:** Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification and Learn to Rank).
* **Data Balancing:** Attribute Selection and Dimensionality Reduction techniques.
* **ML Performance Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Accumulative, ROC and AUC curves.
* **ML Libraries (Python):** sklearn, scipy, pycaret.
* **Version Control:** Git (code versioning), and DVC (data versioning).
* **APIs:** Flask, Streamlit, Amazon API Gateway.
* **MLOps:** AWS tools (S3, EC2, Lambda), Heroku cloud, DVC, MLflow.
